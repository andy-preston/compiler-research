# Crystal Palace Synth

A Docker container to build and use an ARM cross compiler for
[Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/)
targeting Cortex-M4 ARM-based microcontrollers such as the STM32F401CC.

The [Dockerfile](compiler/Dockerfile) also serves as a nice guide to
the rigmarole of building a Free Pascal cross-compiler which you might find
handy in your own projects.

Enjoy!
