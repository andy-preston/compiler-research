# Crystal Palace Synth

## Compiler Docker Container

There's no sign of the actual project this repo is intended for here yet.

**BUT** There's a rather nice Docker container that builds a
[Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/)
compiler for the STM32F401CC.

The [Dockerfile](compiler/Dockerfile) also serves as a nice guide to
the rigmarole of building a Free Pascal cross-compiler which you might find
handy in your own projects.

Enjoy!
